# bob-obringer monorepo

Monorepo for all of my non private projects.

Some are just for fun, some are for work, some are for learning, some are for teaching.

## Public NPM Packages

Packages that I find useful outside of this monorepo, or that you might find
useful are [published to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~bob-obringer).

### [@bob-obringer/eslint-plugin](public-packages/eslint-plugin)

An eslint plugin with some custom rules and configurations that work like me.

### [@bob-obringer/tsconfig](public-packages/tsconfig)

A collection of strict TypeScript configurations that I use for a variety
of projects.

### [@bob-obringer/tw-color-schemes](public-packages/tw-color-schemes)

A color scheme plugin for Tailwind CSS. It allows you to easily create multiple
color schemes using centralized semantic colors instead of explicitly referencing
`light:` or `dark:` throughout your codebase.

### [@bob-obringer/posthog-nextjs](public-packages/nextjs-posthog)

A simple wrapper around the PostHog JS library to make it easier to use with Next.js.

### [@bob-obringer/conventional-changesets](public-packages/conventional-changeset)

Automates the process of independently bumping semantic versions of multiple packages within a monorepo.
