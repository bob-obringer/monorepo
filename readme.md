# bob-obringer monorepo

Monorepo for all of my non private projects.

A bunch of them are useful outside of this monorepo, and are available as public packages. These were created for my own purposes, but you might find them useful as well. Feel free to use them as you see fit.

## Public NPM Packages

Packages that I find useful outside of this monorepo, or that you might find
useful are [published to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~bob-obringer).

### [@bob-obringer/conventional-changesets](public-packages/conventional-changeset)

Automates the process of independently bumping semantic versions of multiple packages within a monorepo.

### [@bob-obringer/eslint-plugin](public-packages/eslint-plugin)

An eslint plugin with some custom rules and configurations that work like me.

### [@bob-obringer/http-errors](public-packages/http-errors)

A collection of HTTP error classes representing the standard HTTP status codes.

### [@bob-obringer/nextjs-posthog](public-packages/nextjs-posthog)

of projects.

### [@bob-obringer/tw-color-schemes](public-packages/tw-color-schemes)

A color scheme plugin for Tailwind CSS. It allows you to easily create multiple
color schemes using centralized semantic colors instead of explicitly referencing
`light:` or `dark:` throughout your codebase.
