Software Craftsman & Startup Enthusiast

I'm a software engineer with over 25 years of experience crafting web
solutions. My expertise lies in front-end development, but I'm also
well-versed in the art of full-stack creation.

Throughout my career, I've witnessed the evolution of front-end
development firsthand. From the early days of the web, when HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript formed the foundation, to the emergence of powerful new
technologies like React and NextJS, I've continually adapted and
expanded my skill set. In recent years, I've professionally added
the blockchain into my skill set.  Most recently, I've been adding
AI skills with embedding models, vector databases, and LLMs.

By staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving technological
landscape, I find joy in building user interfaces that seamlessly
blend form and function, creating digital experiences that captivate
and engage. If you're a startup looking for a dedicated software
engineer to help bring your vision to life, let's join forces to
build the future, one line of code at a time.
